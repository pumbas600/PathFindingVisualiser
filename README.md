# PathFindiningVisualiser
 
A simple Path Finding visualiser built using Javafx.
You can see it in action [here](https://youtu.be/LwiGtwkK3x0)

## Path Finding Algorithms supported:
- A*
- Dijkstra's

## Some Other Interesting Features:
- Random Maze Generator
- Ability to save / load 'mazes' (saves them as .png files)
- Algorithm speed modifier (Watch it solve the maze in slow motion!)
- A node 'comparisons' counter - a somewhat arbitrary way for me to measure efficiency.
